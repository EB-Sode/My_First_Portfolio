            <h3>Controled focus</h3>
            <p>This is the single most important practice in Stoic philosophy: differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t. What we have influence over and what we do not. Or in Epictetus’ language, what is up to us and what is not up to us (ta eph’hemin, ta ouk eph’hemin). Once we have organized our understanding of the world into this stark categorization, what remains—what was so central to Epictetus’s survival as a slave—is to focus on what is up to us. Our attitudes. Our emotions. Our wants. Our desires. Our opinions about what has happened to us. Epictetus believed that as powerless as humans were over their external conditions, they always retained the ability to choose how they responded.</p>
